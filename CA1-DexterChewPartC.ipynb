    "### Report Overview\n",
    "This Notebook is written as a submission report for CA1 Assignment. In the report there will be 3 separate datasets that requires analysis - Part A-C. For this particular report it will be on Datasest A- Titanic Dataset. <br><br> In Part A, I will be analyzing the Titanic Dataset from Kaggle. This is a classification problem to predict whether an individual would have survied the titanic incident. I will be creating a ML pipeline to assess this data. For Part B, I will be analysing the King County dataset and attempt to create a ML model that predicts the housing sales prices. Lastly, for Part C, I will be analyzing my own dataset of interest.\n",
